  <li> System should be easy to manage and also scalable.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Q.2. </h2>
<br>
<h2>Features :</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The software allows users to monitor their hearing health over time and can be connected to decision-support tools to motivate them to take action in the face of        hearing loss.</li>
  <li> When our artificial intelligence detects significant sound occurrences of relevance to this group, it should have the ability to vibrate.</li>
  <li> here should immediately alert the user if anything strange happens.</li>
  <li> Since users are expected to be hearing, audio is thought to be a less important component of the user. However, incorporating audio may be advantageous if the programme is intended to facilitate communication between hearing-impaired and sighted users.</li>
  <li> The method is applied with consideration for the mobile device's distension vibration, which alerts the user to incoming calls or messages.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Scope :</h2>
<ul>
  <li> An integrated noise sensor will detect warnings from nearby objects and analyse the data using artificial intelligence to pinpoint significant sound occurrences.</li>
  <li> Since the hearing-impaired cannot hear the sound coming from their phones, the vibration feature in mobile apps could readily inform them. Other applications for the vibration mode included lesser, higher, and pattern mode. This vibration mode can be altered depending on the severity of the user's hearing loss issue.</li>
  <li> Users within the same community can simply connect with one another. Users may utilise and benefit from this app with ease thanks to its user-friendly UI.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Nonfunctional requirement :</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The user should have a device that can handle the application. Applications should be straightforward so they can be used on any smartphone or device.</li>
  <li> Applications should be straightforward so they can be used on any smartphone or device.</li>
  <li> The system must to contain a hotline number that may assist him in any challenging situations.</li>
